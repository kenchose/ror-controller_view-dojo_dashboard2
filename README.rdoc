Create a quick table showing all the information from created Dojos using the .each method. Create a page with a form where someone can create a new dojo. The url should be "/dojos/new" routing to "dojos#new". Validate the form and display necessary error messages if the form is invalid. Otherwise, display a success message that says the form was submitted.
